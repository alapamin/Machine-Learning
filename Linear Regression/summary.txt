The goal of the hyperplane is to bisect the known data points with minimal distance between itself and each data point. 
This means that if you were to draw a perpendicular line (90-degree angle) from the hyperplane to every data point on the plot, 
the distance of each data point would be the smallest possible distance of any potential hyperplane.

In preparation for building a linear regression model, 
you first need to remove or fill missing values and confirm that the 
independent variables are those most correlated with the dependent variable. 
Those same independent variables, however, should not be correlated with each other.
