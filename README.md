# Machine-Learning

This is the process by which I learnt the basics of machine learning!
Did some exploratory data analysis and data scrubbing.

From there I learnt the implementation for PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and K-Means Clustering,
two very popular pre-model algorithms.

Stil learning so more will be added!
Learning via educative.
